# Routing at Leaf Layer
This exercise presents a demonstration of a data center network infrastructure running EVPN/VXLAN with routing at the leaf layer. The design approach has been taken from the book THIS WEEK: DATA CENTER
DEPLOYMENT WITH EVPN/VXLAN By Deepti Chandra discussed in the Chapter 2 Building a Data Center â€“ Routing at the Leaf Layer.


## Description
Some small deviations from the original setup presented in the book have been made here, for instance the hosts have been substituted by another QFX switch ACCESS-1 and ACCESS-2 which have been configured with multiple routing instance to be able to perform connectivity tests.

## Connectivity tests
Several tests can be performed when the network simulation is fully operational. In particular, intra-VRF L2 and L3 connectivity, inter-VRF connectivity with service insertion and north-south connectivity with service insertion.
All these test can be performed by following the templates stored in the folder [tests](tests).


## Access
All devices are accessible through telnet session towards a host running eve-ng established on a specific TCP port referring to a respective network device. There's a mRemote access profile [mRemote_profile.xml](mRemote_profile.xml) stored in the repository to ease access to devices.
The root account is configured with the password Juniper123.


## Requirements
As this lab consists of many virtual devices it requires either a physical server or a virtual machine with a lot of CPU and RAM resources. More info can be found in the folder requirements.
